# Tauri + React + Typescript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)


Run using: 
```
pnpm tauri dev
```



Opening the Web Inspector
You can open the Web Inspector to debug your application by performing a right-click on the webview and clicking “Inspect” or using the Ctrl + Shift + I shortcut on Windows and Linux or Cmd + Option + I shortcut on macOS.

In the layout settings page, I also want to add options to:
	1.	Show the page title in the sidebar when it’s collapsed.
	2.	Fully collapse the sidebar.

Feature Ideas:

lets also have an option to scroll between requirements on reaching the end of a given requirement in a page like google doc does between the different titles.

read the track element within viewport.


TODOS:
