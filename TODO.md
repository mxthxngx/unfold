# TODO

## Bugs / Issues
- **Fix state management**
- **weird white flash coming in start of app**
- **Fix tailwind css colors**
- **Click-to-place cursor (Notion-style):** Clicking anywhere on the page should focus the last empty node when there are multiple lines, not the first line.
- **Scrollbar:** Scrollbar appears even when content doesn’t reach the end.
- **Checkbox alignment:** Checkbox and line don’t align.
- **Tab in paragraphs:** Tab doesn’t work when there’s a paragraph.
- **Escape:** Escape should clear text selection; selection behavior is inconsistent.
- **Placeholder:** Placeholder should show at the cursor position.
- **Page switch loader:** Show a skeleton when switching pages until the new page is fully loaded.
- **iOS right-click:** Right-clicking on Unfold (prod) should not show the default iOS right-click menu.
- In mobile view the space modal input is not working; fallback to shadcn modal if too annoying.

## Feature plans

- **Math & tables:** Add math (e.g. LaTeX) support and fix table integration.
- **Clickable links:** Make links in the editor clickable.
- **Slash menu:** Implement slash menu for block commands.
- **Page history:** Undo/redo or version history per page.
- **Space shortcuts:** Allow custom shortcuts to switch between spaces.
- **Read-it-later / curl:** Paste a link and fetch the full webpage (e.g. via curl) and integrate it into Unfold for reading without distractions. I also want to have the option to add like notes to this? So when we curl a website, we basically can ask ai to explain a section, and look back at that while revising, or like ability to add "scribbles/comments"
- **Trash**
- **AI for search, RAG across a space**
