# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Report vulnerabilities privately to the repository maintainers with:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested remediation

Maintainers will acknowledge and triage the report as quickly as possible.
